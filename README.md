# Code collection related to NVDA

After years and years of coding in NVDA ecosystem, I have decided to create this repository to have and provide an easily linkable, multi-purpose place where to show procedures, document techniques, and so on.

It's organized like a FAQ section, as to be a good reference for both beginner and advanced users.

Remember: even if/when you find here a working module, it's only to illustrate the main concept; you will have to adjust code for your needs, manage errors, introduce checks... and test, test again, and still test! ðŸ˜œ

Now, let's go!

## I'm looking a way to...

* ...get the document path currently opened in foreground editor/viewer, like notepad, Adobe Reader, etc: if document was opened starting from explorer (a quite common case, I think), [there may be a solution](/scratchpad/globalPlugins/getOpenFilePath.py)
